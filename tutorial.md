Here we explain how to set up your development environment so that you can build Docker containers, either on the Google Cloud Platform or on your local machine.

3. [Building the Dockerfile](/tutorial/building-the-dockerfile)  
This section covers how to convert your code base into a Docker image.

4. [Submitting the Docker Image](/tutorial/submitting)  
Here, we describe the process of taking your Docker container and submitting it to the Reproducibility Track's automatic verification tool.
